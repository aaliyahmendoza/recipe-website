    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A macaron is a delicate meringue-based cookie sandwich made primarily from egg whites, 
        almond four, and sugar. The outside is crisp but inside they’re more moist and chewy.

            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <h4><u>Macarons</u></h4>
    </ul>
    <ol>
            <li>Sift confectioners sugar & almond flour into a bowl</li>
            <li>Add room temperature egg whites into a very clean bowl</li>
            <li>Using and electric mixer, whisk egg whites. Once they begin to foam, add the cream 
                of tartar and the SLOWLY add the granulated sugar</li>
            <li>Add the food coloring (if desired) and vanilla then mix in. 
                Continue to beat until stiff peaks form</li>
            <li>Begin folding in 1/3 of the DRY ingredients</li>
            <li>Be careful to add the remaining dry ingredients and fold gently</li>
            <li>The final mixture should look like flowing lava, and be able to fall into a figure 
                eight without breaking. Spoon into a piping bag with a medium round piping tip and 
                you’re ready to start piping</li>
            <li>Pipe one inch dollops onto a baking sheet lined with parchment paper (this should 
                be glued down with dabs of batter). Tap on counter several times to release air bubbles. 
                Allow to sit for about 40 minutes before placing in oven.</li>
            <li>Bake at 300F for 12-15 minutes, rotate tray after 7 minutes. Allow to cool completely 
                before removing from baking sheet</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <h4><u>French Buttercream</u></h4>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine sugar and water in medium saucepan. Heat over low heat while stirring until 
            sugar dissolves. Increase heat to medium- high and bring to a boil</li>
        <li>Put egg yolks in a stand-mixer fitted with a whisk attachment and beat until thick 
            and foamy</li>
        <li>Cook the sugar and water syrup until it reaches 240 degrees F. Immediately remove 
            from heat. With mixer running, SLOWLY drizzle hot syrup into bowl with yolks</li>
        <li>Continue mixing until the bottom of the bowl is cool to the touch and the yolk mixture 
            has cooled to room temperature</li>
        <li>Add in butter one cube at a time allowing each piece to incorporate before adding the next. 
            Add vanilla and salt. Continue mixing until buttercream is smooth and creamy. 
            (About 5-6 minutes.) Add food coloring if desired</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <h4><u>Assembly</u></h4>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>Pipe your filling onto the back of half the shells. Form a sandwich and repeat. Macarons 
            should be aged in the fridge for 1-3 days for best results. This allows the filling to 
            soften the shells inside</li>
    </ol>
